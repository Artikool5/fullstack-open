## Exercise 0.4

```mermaid

  participant browser
    participant server

    browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: Server updates list of notes and sends everything from the beginning

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes

```

## Exercise 0.5

The process of initial page loading for SPA is very similar to the classic web page,
the only difference is that it needs more JavaScript initially to have all the
notes handling logic.

```mermaid

  participant browser
  participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The JS file is different and contains more instructions on form handling

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "HTML is easy", "date": "2023-1-1" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the callback function that renders the notes
```

## Exercise 0.6

In SPA we don't get anything back from server after the POST request. The notes are updated locally

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant browser
  participant server

  browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
  loop UpdateLocalNotes
    browser->>browser: Append new note to the list of notes
  end
```
